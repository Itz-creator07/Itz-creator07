# 👋 Hi, I’m Itzalen

Welcome to my space—where **AI**, **cybersecurity**, and **systems thinking** meet.  
I explore how technology behaves, where risk emerges, and what thoughtful design really means.

🎯 I’m a strategic technologist with a background in **AI/ML**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Data Science**.  
🔍 My work spans system behavior, risk analysis, and ethical questions in emerging technologies.  
🛠️ From network security to AI model research, I focus on how systems work, where they break, and what’s often left unexamined.

### 🧬 **WiDS Datathon 2025 – ADHD Prediction in the Female Brain**
🧠 *Break Through Tech AI Program (Spring 2025)*
🏆 👩‍🔬 *UCLA Team 2 – Kaggle Challenge (Top Winner)*
🎯 **76% Accuracy | Top 15% Kaggle Ranking (157/1,075) | 1st Place UCLA**
Explored sex-specific patterns in ADHD using machine learning to understand how the female brain uniquely responds to the condition. Achieved top winner status among 26 UCLA teams and ranked in top 15% globally on Kaggle by developing ensemble models (Decision Trees + Random Forest) that identified gender-based neurological differences, contributing to more personalized ADHD diagnostics and treatment approaches.

### 🌍 **AI Life Ladder Prediction Model**
🧠 *Break Through Tech AI Program (Summer 2024)*
📊 *World Happiness Report Dataset (1,562 country-year observations)*
🎯 **82% R² Accuracy | Top 5 Well-Being Predictors Identified**
Built a Random Forest regression model to predict Life Ladder scores (self-reported well-being) using socio-economic and political indicators. Achieved 82% R² on test data, revealing that GDP per capita (35% importance) and social support (25% importance) are the strongest drivers of national happiness—insights valuable for policy evaluation and resource allocation.
