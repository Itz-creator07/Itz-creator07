# 👋 Hi, I’m Itzalen

Welcome to my space—where **AI**, **cybersecurity**, and **systems thinking** meet.  
I explore how technology behaves, where risk emerges, and what thoughtful design really means.

🎯 I’m a strategic technologist with a background in **AI/ML**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Data Science**.  
🔍 My work spans system behavior, risk analysis, and ethical questions in emerging technologies.  
🛠️ From network security to AI model research, I focus on how systems work, where they break, and what’s often left unexamined.
